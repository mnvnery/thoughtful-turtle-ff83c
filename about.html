  The ability to adapt to different proposals and, at the same time, achieve a connection with the most intimate core of each story is, precisely, one of the challenges that Pedro always pursues in his work.

  In "Ex-Shaman", by Luiz Bolognesi, a film about the ethnocide suffered by an indigenous community in Amazonas, his work once again attracts Variety's attention: “What’s not conjectural is the photographic beauty of the widescreen images, shot by Pedro J. Márquez with a timeless stillness that seems to resist the race toward change that began in 1969 and has caused so much destruction ever since". The movie won a Special Mention at the Berlinale in 2018, among other international awards.
